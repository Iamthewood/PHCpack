This directory contains a basic interface of phc with Maple.
The files are

  run_phc_mapleV        procedure run_phc in MapleV for unix
  use_phc_mapleV.mws    illustrative worksheet to use run_phc in MapleV

  run_phc_maple6        procedure run_phc in Maple6 for unix
  use_phc_maple6.mws    illustrative worksheet to use run_phc in Maple6

  run_phc_maple7        latest and shortest version of run_phc
  use_phc_maple7.mws

The differences between the versions is mainly due to the % symbol
and string manipulations.

PHCmaple, developed in collaboration with Anton Leykin,
is available separately.
