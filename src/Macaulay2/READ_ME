This directory contains two Macaulay2 packages exporting some of the
functionality of phc to the M2 user: PHCpack.m2 and LRhomotopies.m2.

(1) PHCpack.m2 (along with its documentation in PHCpackDoc.m2 in the
    directory PHCpack).  This M2 interface was developed jointly with
    Elizabeth Gross and Sonja Petrovic, with contributions of Anton Leykin.

    To install this interface, in an M2 session started in a terminal
    in this directory, type

installPackage("PHCpack", RemakeAllDocumentation=>true, RerunExamples => true, UserMode=>true,DebuggingMode => true)

(2) LRhomotopies.m2 gives access to the Littlewood-Richardson homotopies
    to solve Schubert problems.  This package was created during an exciting
    week at AIM on implementing algebraic algorithms, 26-30 October 2009.
    The package was updated during the week of July 24-29, 2011,
    at a Macaulay 2 workshop held at the IMA.

    See rule.m2 for a very basic use as a script, run it as 
    $ M2 --rule.m2
    on the command prompt $.

    To install the package, in an M2 session, type

installPackage("LRhomotopies", RemakeAllDocumentation=>true, RerunExamples => true, UserMode=>true,DebuggingMode => true)

After successful installation, typing viewHelp() launches a browser to view
the documentation and examples of its use.
